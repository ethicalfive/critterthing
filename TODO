X lighting fix

X rotate sun in roundworld

X select species from species panel

X fetch/catch file & bzip2 operations

X weight calculation fixes

X infostats fixes

X new framelimiter

X roundworld option in map file > made profile instead

X correct XYZ axis

X roundworld profile: killhaf_increaseZ 1

X map scaling

X debug drawer fixes

X check all "map" files

X fix --race

X put a cap on food_lifetime insertion interval

X default texture for textureless materials

X crash when grabbing and canvas disabled

X <Eth|cal> sometimes critters flicker between white and normal colour in the critterview

X turn sun at roundworld

X fpslimit stopped working? 

X skyboxes

X CRITTER VISION TIED TO SKY

X fixed critter_procinterval

- check if limit 1 & limit 2 seperate constraints works out

- exclude carnivores from eating herbs a

- rename all percent mutatables to weights

- read sightrange from critterb

- couple cost to sightrange if mutate is on

- parent & child cannot eat each other (can't eat in 1st perfect of life + can't eat right after birth)

- fix maxlifetime mutating

- skybox goes bigger than worldsize > tune critter/cam vision zfar & exapand skybox again.

- same alpha on food as critter?

- options for which map to load?

- follow mode: roundworld just needs it's orientation fixed in 

- follow mode: check that raycaster, seems off

- draw the sun

- console output garbage

- roundworld gravity related to worldsize

- load / save slots

- shader cleanups

- observed offsetted bodypart<>constraint position

- cube food option

- physics material files

- mutate maxlifetime + mincprocreate_energy + sightrange!!!!!! finish these

- position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; >>>>>>>>> gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;

- physics_materials.xml

- pulse contract constraints in & out? caterpillar

- immortal option on critters

- option to alter insert height of food & adams

- critter follow mouse-rotatable around critter

- select multiple autoexchange dirs

- render critters in species order, less glcolor calls

- resize brainviews mininimum size

- hover above critter camera mode

X make critter vision alpha factor relate to species

- grep these: BeWidgetPtr get( const std::string name );

- save selected critters only?

- Window Headers as in F1 window

- default settings for brainview

- check all settings

- remove 1 pixel spacer in crittervision!

X killhalf settings to F12, make % population_eliminate_limt

- option to allow multiple connections / plane

- test crash & limits of 2.5 million+ synapses / critter when opening brainview

- field of view broken


beta13.1
--------

X bzip compression on critters

X disabled testworld & concaveworld

X OpenMP is now optional

X fix make install

X removed obsolete libusb dependency

X fix: autoexchange segfault

X boost linking fix

beta13
------

X selfcollisions & camera precision in f6 window

X fix/disable autoexchange

X optimise, make theaded & fix brainview further

X make bullet static

X changed decreasing energy by percentage to the unit

X activate food when map changes

X cost / bodypart

X mutationrate : more precise

X rejuvenate like 25%

X adapt F1 panel

X test dying critter on constraint

X segfault when duplicating critters

X retina of critters : 2048 x 2048 atm, do like cd2
  retinasperrow in worldb ???

X optimise neuroninterz process (cachegrind)

X when switching fs, reposition the hud

X pixel offset in the hud

X adjust brain weights for more synapses

X braincosts & bodycosts, smaller influence

X lighting & colors

X food count reporting fix

X fix freeEnergy floating point drift

X speciesview is not accurate, wrong color with wrong number of neurons

X if the SEEN critter  (by critter) is of the same species, differentiate by alpha

X threads in other modes

X simply do not insert food if > critters kill limit

X critters can now see if other critters are of the same species
