1.0-beta15
------------
Branched to Critterthing
FIX: Profiles now save all settings data
FIX: Rare brainview segfault

ADDED: sams_mode fitness function mode
	fitness_jump - selects critters for best height
	fitness_height - selects critters for best averaged height over lifetime
	fitness_distance - selects critters for best distance travelled
	Graph displays fitness over generations instead of critter population size and food
	Fitness panel becomes available in this mode for changing fitness related settings
ADDED: Text entry widgets for settings	-- **Thanks Bob Winklemans for helping me to get this working when I found your unused text input code. 
	UP/DOWN arrow keys cycle through history of text entry widget
ADDED: Neuron input types
	Random: Randomly on or off
	Pulse1-4: On or Off, 1 of 2, 1 of 5, 1 of 10 and 1 of 50 frames
ADDED: Carnivores - Throwback from 1.0beta9, It enables a random chance of a critter becoming a carnivore, which is
	passed to its offspring only, unlike omnivores which effects critters simulation wide.
ADDED: Profile Saves with Save All Critters (PAGEDOWN key) to the saved critter directory 
ADDED: Profile will load if present when starting with the --autoloadlastsaved commandline option
ADDED: population_rand_toggle & population_eliminate_portion_toggle_exchange_rand which turn autoexchange on and off *EXPERIMENTAL AND DODGY IMPLEMENTATION*

CHANGED: Removed select by age when killing percentage at population cap
CHANGED: Food, from circular back to cubes from 1.0-beta13 and earlier versions. Round food while technically cooler would roll into low geometry of maps, 
	which led to critters clinging to the bottom ditches of maps, waiting for food to roll in. Limited the creativity of maps
CHANGED: Potential Decay
CHANGED: Race mode. Critters would use the walls as guides to push against, so these were removed and the level was given various tweaks
